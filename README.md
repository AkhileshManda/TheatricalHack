## Inspiration
Many artists are unaware of auditions opportunities and hence miss out. Moreover, many directors are unable to discover talent, Also setting the stage and searching for props becomes an issue our app solves this issue using augmented reality. As a result, we devised an app to assist in the resolution of these issues.

## What it does
- So, first and foremost, it displays all of the accessible audition information for performers.
- Playwrights can advertise their auditions on this app.
- Rookie scriptwriters and playwrights may post their screenplays for others to examine, giving them the opportunity to direct plays.
- Buy props, before buying they can visualize this using AR on their phones, the shop includes costumes as well as props, that theatre enthusiasts can see and buy.

## How we built it
Flutter, firebase, ModelViewer 

## Challenges we ran into
- We weren't comfortable using git, hence collaborating on the same repository became difficult.
- Firebase was completely new to us, and it took time to read through the documentation and code a working backend
- Fiding more 3D models which could run using ModelViewer was challenging.
- Resolving packages error due to version of flutter
- Trying to filter auditions based on location was difficult and could not be done

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a fully functional app with a working backend and a working AR model

## What we learned
- We learnt how to integrate a firebase project to a flutter app
- learnt how to work with the Firestore database
- learnt how to implement user authentication using firebase
- learnt how to implement AR feature in a flutter app using ModelViewer
- learnt about the key libraries in the ModelViewer package
- Importance of Branching and resolving merge conflicts
- learnt how to use the git command line and moved on from uploading files directly

## What's next for Theatrical Buddy
- We wish to add a feature where auditions can be filtered based on location
- Adding short videos where artists can upload to be motivated.
- Including educational videos to help newcomers learn more.
- Add more AR models for better visualization of props placement on stage and costumes.
